The DriverPass project was built for Liam, the owner of DriverPass, and Ian, the IT officer. Their goal was to design a secure, cloud-based system that helps students better prepare for their DMV driving tests through online learning, practice exams, 
and on-the-road training. The system lets students create accounts, schedule lessons, and access study materials anytime while allowing staff to manage accounts, reports, and schedules. It also keeps everything updated with the latest DMV rules and 
policies automatically. What I did well in this project was clearly define both the functional and non-functional requirements so the system met performance, security, and user accessibility goals. I also think I did a solid job showing how everything 
connects through the UML diagrams and explaining the technical details in a way that still ties back to what the client actually needs.

If I were to go back and change anything, I’d revise the use case and activity diagrams to include more real-world scenarios, such as scheduling conflicts or password recovery steps. That would make the design even more complete and realistic. 
I focused heavily on interpreting the user's needs by keeping the system simple, fast, and secure, something that works for both students and staff without being overly complicated. Considering the user’s needs is important because it’s what determines 
if a system actually solves the problem it’s built for. When I approach software design, I like to start by breaking down requirements, then mapping everything out visually with UML diagrams to see how the system fits together. Going forward, I plan 
to use more iterative design techniques and gather user feedback early so I can refine the system as it’s being developed, not just after it’s finished.
